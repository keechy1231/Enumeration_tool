# Enumeration_tool
A tool that will run nmap -sV -sC, nmap -p- and gobuster directory scan on any web servers on port 80. 

-q for quiet mode, which will only output to the filename you specify. 

Initially made to use for Easy CTF boxes and the eJPT exam. 

I am currently learning python so if you have any suggestions on how I could improve my code plese let me know. 


Next step is to use multithreading and possibly service detection and directory enumeration on ports other than 80. 


Thank you
