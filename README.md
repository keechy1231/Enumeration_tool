# Enumeration_tool
A tool that will run nmap -sV -sC -Pn, nmap -p- -Pn and gobuster directory scan on any web servers on port 80. 

Fist version will mainly concentrate on getting the tool working, then later on I will look at getting more tools and functionality added. 

Initially made to use for Easy CTF boxes and eht eJPT exam. 

I am currently learning python so if you have any suhhestions on how I could improve my code plese let me know. 

Thank you
