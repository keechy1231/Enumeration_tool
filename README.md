# Enumeration_tool
A tool that will run nmap -sV -sC, nmap -p- and gobuster directory scan on any web servers on port 80. 

Script now works - gobuster file output to work on next - then possibly getting it to run multithreaded (no idea how)

Also need to add functionality to the -q argument to supress any output. 

Initially made to use for Easy CTF boxes and eht eJPT exam. 

I am currently learning python so if you have any suhhestions on how I could improve my code plese let me know. 

Thank you
